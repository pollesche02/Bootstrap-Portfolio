      <p> My name is Danielle Pollesche. I love to work with people and enjoy a fun energized environment.
          I have worked in several different industries from Credit Card Services, Residential Real Estate,
          to Managing a Retail Business.
        <br> <br>
        The one common theme was people which is what I enjoy so much. With the right team and environment
          you can accomplish anything you set your mind to! I am trying to expand my technical expertise in 
          coding so I can bring a different perspective to what I do and apply different solutions.
          <br>
         At the end of the day it's all about having a great environment with good people!
          <br><br>
         I am currently working with KC's Home Fragrances. I am working on their Web Enhancement. I am currently 
         working on updating their current website and creating a mobile app for the company.
